# project-dolos
A Chromium/Chrome extension made to make usage of OpenAI's API in the browser easier than ever. Features like playground mini, use selected text as prompt in the right-click menu as well as templates with predefined prompts and config for grammar, sentence clarity etc. Dalle API implementation might come in the future. Depending on how well the extension will perform I might put it up on Google Web Store for everyone to download, but now is no time to think about that.
## Dolos
Greek god of trickery/deception. I chose this name because I could easily imagine someone using this for writing a longer text work, especially with the new davinci-003 model. Taking the easy way, cheating. The greek god of intelligence is already taken for the Minesweeper AI project (I might have to eventually complete the project :). Use with caution.
